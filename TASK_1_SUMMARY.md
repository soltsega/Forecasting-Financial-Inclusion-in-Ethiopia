# Task 1: Data Exploration and Enrichment - Completion Report

## Objective
The primary goal of Task 1 was to understand the foundational financial inclusion dataset for Ethiopia, verify its structure, and enrich it with authority-backed data to support subsequent forecasting.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Dataset Acquisition & Schema Fix
- **Dataset Located**: Identified `ethiopia_fi_unified_data - ethiopia_fi_unified_data.csv` as the primary source.
- **Schema Optimization**: The original dataset was missing the `parent_id` column, which is critical for linking events to indicators. I programmatically updated the schema to include this field.

### 2. Data Exploration & Profiling
- **Record Counts**:
    - **Observations**: 31 (Initially 30)
    - **Events**: 11 (Initially 10)
    - **Impact Links**: 2 (Newly created)
    - **Targets**: 3
- **Temporal Range**: Data covers the period from **2014 to 2025**.
- **Indicators**: 19 unique indicator codes identified across Access, Usage, Affordability, and Gender pillars.

### 3. Data Enrichment (The "Under the Hood" Work)
To improve the forecasting model's accuracy, I integrated the following high-priority records:
| Record ID | Type | Source | Detail |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| **REC_0034** | Observation | NBE | June 2024: 110 million mobile money accounts. |
| **EVT_0011** | Event | IMF | July 2024: Approval of 4-year ECF arrangement. |
| **IMP_0001** | Impact Link | Literature | Connects Telebirr Launch to Account Ownership growth. |
| **IMP_0002** | Impact Link | Literature | Connects M-Pesa Launch to Mobile Money growth. |

### 4. Technical Environment
- **Exploration Notebook**: Created [01_data_exploration_and_enrichment.ipynb](notebooks/01_data_exploration_and_enrichment.ipynb) containing data profiling and initial analysis.
- **Enrichment Log**: Established [data_enrichment_log.md](data_enrichment_log.md) to maintain clear provenance for all added data.
- **Placeholder Setup**: Created notebook shells for Task 2 (EDA), Task 3 (Modeling), and Task 4 (Forecasting).

## Conclusion
Task 1 is mathematically and structurally complete. The dataset is now ready for deep Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2).
